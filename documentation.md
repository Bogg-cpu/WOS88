# Operations

Operations on the WOS88 are formed with three words; the Operation word, the Source word and the Target word.

As such, operations may be written as followed:

<span style="font-size: 15px; font-weight: bold;">24 04 02</span> (XOR D Register into B Register)

### Following is the operation table:
